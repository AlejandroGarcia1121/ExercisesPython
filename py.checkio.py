This mission is the easiest one. Write a function that will receive 2 numbers as input and it should return the multiplication of these 2 numbers.
    Input: Two arguments. Both are of type int.
    Output: Int.
    Example:
        mult_two(2, 3) == 6
        mult_two(1, 0) == 0

You have a positive integer. Try to find out how many digits it has?
    Input: A positive Int    
    Output: An Int.

You are given a string and you have to find its first word.
    The input string consists of only English letters and spaces.
    There arenâ€™t any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.

    How it is used: The first word is a command in a command line.
    Precondition: The text can contain a-z, A-Z and spaces.
